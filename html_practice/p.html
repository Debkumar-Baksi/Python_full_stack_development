                The higher we soar, the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly.<br>  
                There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.<br>  
                He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.<br>  
                Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?<br>  
                You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra? You are my believers, but what matter all believers?<br>  
                You had not yet sought yourselves: then did you find me. So do all believers: therefore all belief is of so little account.<br>  
                Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have all denied me will I return to you.<br> <br>

                The free man is a warrior.<br>  
                What is good? All that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself in man.<br>  
                What is bad? All that proceeds from weakness.<br>  
                The weak and ill-constituted shall perish: first principle of our philanthropy.<br>  
                And one shall help them to do so.<br>  
                What is more harmful than any vice? Active sympathy for the ill-constituted and weak.<br>  
                To demand of strength that it should not express itself as strength, that it should not be a will to overpower, a will to dominate, a will to become master—a demand of life that it should suppress its most essential conditions.<br>  
                Life itself is the will to power: self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent results.<br>  
                He who cannot obey himself will be commanded.<br>  
                The noble soul has reverence for itself.<br> <br>

                I teach you the overman. Man is something that shall be overcome.<br>  
                What have you done to overcome him?<br>  
                All beings so far have created something beyond themselves: and you want to be the ebb of that great tide, and rather go back to the beast than overcome man?<br>  
                What is the greatest thing you can experience? It is the hour of great contempt.<br>  
                The hour in which even your happiness becomes loathsome to you, and so also your reason and your virtue.<br>  
                The hour in which you say: "What good is my happiness? It is poverty and filth, and a miserable ease."<br>  
                Man is a rope, fastened between animal and overman—a rope over an abyss.<br>  
                A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting.<br>  
                What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal.<br>  
                What is lovable in man is that he is an over-going and a down-going.<br> <br>

            The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart.<br>  
            One must imagine Sisyphus happy.<br>  
            There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn.<br>  
            At any street corner, the feeling of absurdity can strike any man in the face.<br>  
            Autumn is a second spring when every leaf is a flower.<br>  
            The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.<br>  
            Seeking what is true is not seeking what is desirable.<br>  
            In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.<br>  
            Don’t walk in front of me; I may not follow.<br>  
            Don’t walk behind me; I may not lead.<br>  
            Walk beside me, just be my friend.<br>

            Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.<br>  
            There is no love of life without despair of life.<br>  
            To be happy, we must not be too concerned with others.<br>  
            A man is more a man by the things he keeps to himself than by those he says.<br>  
            Fate is not in man but around him.<br>  
            Real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present.<br>  
            I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.<br>  
            I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.<br>  
            There is scarcely any passion without struggle.<br>  
            Life can be magnificent and overwhelming—that is its whole tragedy.<br>

            Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?<br>  
            In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.<br>  
            Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.<br>  
            Man is always prey to his truths. Once he has admitted them, he cannot free himself from them.<br>  
            At the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman.<br>  
            There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.<br>  
            Live to the point of tears.<br>  
            A man without ethics is a wild beast loosed upon this world.<br>  
            Without freedom, no art; art lives only on the restraints it imposes on itself.<br>  
            The absurd is the essential concept and the first truth.<br>
